    "#### Determining challenges to tackle\n",
    "The vast amount of information available has led to an overwhelming number of choices for users. As a result, recommendation systems have become essential tools for developers to help users discover relevant products or content. Traditional methods often relied on keywords filtering or content-based filtering, but advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and transformer models have opened up new possibilities for building more sophisticated and context-aware recommendation systems.\n"
